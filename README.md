To begin, a limerick:

    If what you desire is data,
    then nothing will pleasure you greater:
    Through the web-based UI
    or the REST API,
    pull your data right out of the Crater


This is Crater, in t'ya face: a user interface for the [Crater](https://gitlab.hq.jadu.net/spacecraft/crater) database.

Reads and writes data from the database, and also gives a centralised integraton UI for all the many tools and platforms we use.

Greater visibility. Greater power. Greater ease.
